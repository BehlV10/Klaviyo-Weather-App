- Solution for https://www.klaviyo.com/weather-app
- This is a weather app that can be run to at any time to send any email addresses in the subscription page an email with the latest weather update for their location
- Written using Python 3 and the latest version of Django with PyDev/Eclipse
- Assuming all the migrations are in tact, you can run it using python manage.py runserver
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/subscribe/ is the subscription page
- "python manage.py sendemails" should send off emails to all the users

Thanks!
